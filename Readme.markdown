What about AppHarbour?

Without a doubt, AppHarbour is a great tool for deploying simple cloud hosted websites.
By design, AppHarbour has decided to be very simple. PowerUp gives far more control.

In particular:
- You can deploy more than websites
- You can substitute virtually anything, not just app settings
- You can run arbitrary powershell scripts, not be limited to a simple git-pull scenario

Horses for courses.
In theory, there is potential to allow PowerUp to enhance AppHarbour deployments. This has not been explored in detail at this stage.
